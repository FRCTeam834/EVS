# Coprocessor-Vision
The Code for the Coprocessor for Vision

This code ultilizes the EdgeIQ library from AlwaysAI to process images. The application then puts the values onto a NetworkTable,
where they can be accessed by the Rio. It is currently using a RasPi as the processor, but an Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 will be 
used later for higher framerate. The EdgeIQ library is still in Beta, so the project can't become public until the library is released.
